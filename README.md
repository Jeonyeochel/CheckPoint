#Check-Point

##Http request auto validation library for spring framework

Check-Point depends on

[Jackson Json Processor](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [Project Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/),
[Apache POI](https://github.com/apache/poi)

 Check-Point is a library that automatically checks the integrity of request messages that developers are most likely to miss during the spring project development.
 
Null check, minimum, maximum value of message..

You do not need to code anymore, just only need to click the checkbox on the setting page.

#
#####I realized that I was born into a person who can not fully handle message exceptions and developed this library.

####Are you a diligent person who can handle exceptions for every message?
